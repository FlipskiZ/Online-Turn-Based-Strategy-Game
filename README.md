# Online Turn Based Strategy Game

You need at least 2 players on different computers to play. Or, alternatively play alone on 1 computer, but there is no AI in the game.

The client code+exe is located in the /Client directory and the server code+exe is located in the /Server directory.

This game is still in its early stages, so don't expect it to have too many features. Everything that is implemented should work properly though, unless stated otherwise.
This game doesn't represent the final game, and everything is subject to change.

How to play:

Camera movement: WASD
Place a miner building: Left click
End turn: Enter
Send chat message: Enter when the chat box is selected

There is no *End goal* currently. But you can fill out the entire board with buildings, which could be seen as the end goal.
The first building you place is your capital, you can place this building anywhere as long as it's not beside an enemy building.
You can only place buildings beside buildings you already own.
If you place a building beside an unowned building, it becomes your building.
You start with 50 of each resource.
It costs 10 of every resource to place a building.
When everyone ends their turn, the next turn begins. At the end of each turn every building gives you 10 of the resource it is placed on.
