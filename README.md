# Online Turn Based Strategy Game

You need at least 2 players on different computers to play.

LAN is currently not supported, but is planned to be supported in a future update, when I get it working that is.

The client code+exe is located in the /Client directory and the server code+exe is located in the /Server directory.

This game is still in it's early stages, so don't expect it to have too many features. Everything that is implemented should work properly though.
